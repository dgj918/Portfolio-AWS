Step 1: Define the access patterns you think you’ll need

1. Get issue by ID
2. Get issue by State (doing, done, todo, closed)
3. Get project by ID
4. Get sub task by issue ID
5. Get sub task by ID
6. story by type
7. story by status
8. sub task by status
9. List all stories of a given project
10. List all sub task of a given story


Step 2: Create a DynamoDB table with three generic attributes: “partition key”, “sort key”, and “data”
Partition Key       Sort Key        Data                        Title   Date_Started    Estimate    Time_Logged
user ID             Project ID      Status
user ID             Story ID        Status#ProjectID       
user ID             Sub Task ID     Status#ProjectID#StoryID


Step 3: Create an item in the DynamoDB table for each record in each entity (non-join) table
Partition Key       Sort Key (GSI PK)   Data (GSI SK)
Project ID          Title#Status        Closed
Story ID            ProjectID#Status    Closed
Sub Task ID         StoryID#Status      Closed

Step 4: Represent many-to-many relationships with adjacency lists

Step 5 (optional): Create more GSIs to support additional access pattterns
